## Game Intro

<h5>
DrawingBee is a fun online drawing game. You can join a room or create your own rooms to play with your friends! 
</h5>
 
<h5>
To start a game, simply login by providing a user name and selecting one of the room options. Players take turns drawing different things (drawer) while other players (guessers) try to guess what the drawing is. The turn ends when the time runs out. If the word was guessed correctly, the guesser rewards scores. The round score will be displayed at the end of each game. The rank and total score will be displayed on the score board.
